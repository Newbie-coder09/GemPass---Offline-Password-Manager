# GemPass---Offline-Password-Manager
This is an offline password generator tool in which you can generate and save passwords. 

Password Manager: This is a GUI based random password generator and saver program. This program can generate 8 and 16 Digit passwords with Alphabets (Lower and Upper case), Symbols and Numbers so, it will be almost impossible to hack a guy who's using this password. The passwords are generated using a very random algorithm and its impossible to guess it or get the same password again using the program. The program uses Random class and only the person who created the random class can guess the password and that's also almost equal to impossible. You can check the saved passwords whenever required.

Feature(v1):
* Can generate 8 and 16 digit passwords.
* Password contains Alphabets (Lower and Upper case), Symbols and Numbers randomly.
* You can edit the final password in the program and then copy.
* Generated passwords are very random.
* Can save passwords for future use (Requires login).
* Generates and save passwords in a hidden directory of the hard disk with encrypton so, its very secure.

Code: I've uploaded the JAVA file of this program named "MyFrame.java" and "LoginPage.java", simply use these files or open these files and copy paste the code.

Details about code:
* The code is self explanatory.

Issues(v1):
* Sometimes program misses to use Symbols or Numbers in 8 Digit pass (Solution: Generate pass again).
